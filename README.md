# php_forms
Thi is a simple travel form made using HTML, CSS and PHP.
besides the basic HTML tags, I have used the following tags in this form L:

<form>
<input >
<label>
<p>

In order to establish the database connection, I have used mysqli() (procedural) approach.
I have used phpmyadmin to establish a localhost.
